### Care for a story?  ðŸ‘‹

Here I am, a teenage software engineer with a knack for JavaScript and the Cloud. Trust me when i say, a code for my life is to make lives easier for everyone around me, using my present skills, Software Engineering and People skills ðŸ˜„. 

Presently I'm building a number of projects that are focused on helping African students to "be more" while smacking my keyboard to make *magic!*, When I'm not testing an app on localhost3001 or port 3000, I'm testing apps on Android simulator and expo.

Oh, have to go now, my keyboard calls with red lines that prevent successful execution ðŸŒ±.



ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on myself and a number of React applications
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node and React Native
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Node
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React and Frontend
